"Shows that the running times of shuffling and decryption adds to
approximately the running time of mixing. Furthermore, the
communication of shuffling and decryption adds approximately to the
communication of mixing. Similarly, the sizes of the proofs of
shuffling and decryption adds approximately to the size of the proof
of mixing."
